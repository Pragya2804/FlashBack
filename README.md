# FlashBack
Flashback is a prototype of a smart whiteboard that can expand the physical limitations of classic whiteboards into virtual space by using the already existing PCs and projectors in offices and classroom and additional cameras. It stores and retrieves information by associating them with keys. Thus making the information non-volatile and reusable. For example, storing the derivation of formula(information) with the formula as the key. The board will only have the formula. That will be used to retrieve its derivation on the monitor or projector screen.
